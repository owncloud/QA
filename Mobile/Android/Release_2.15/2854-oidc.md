| Test Case | Description | Expected | Result | Comments |
| :-------- | :---------- | :------- | :----: | :------- |
|**User flow**|
| Correct OIDC URL | Set a correct OIDC URL | Connection set to the URL | F m10 | Message to improve |  |
| Enter correct iDP credentials | 1. Set a correct OIDC URL<br>2. Enter correct credentials | Login in account | P m10 |  |  |
| Cancel login process | 1. Set a correct OIDC URL<br>2. In iDP, cancel login process<br> | Back to login view. Correct login view | P m10 |  |  |
| Token renewal | 1. Set a correct OIDC URL<br>2. Complete login process in iDP<br>3. Wait 10 minutes | Session keeps going on with no interruption | P m10 |  |  |
| Logout  | 1. Login in a OIDC server instance<br>2. Try to logout  in the idP | Session logged out. Needed credentials again to enter the account | NA |  |
|**Request flow**|
| Authorization  | 1. Enter an OIDC URL<br>2. Enter credentials and accept scope<br> | 1. Checked openid-configuration endpoint<br>2. Check logon, hello endpoints returning correct scope. Session starts | P m10 |  |
| Renewal  | 1. Wait till a OIDC token expires | Session is silently renewed. Check that the POST to the token endpoint retrieves a new valid token. Refresh token is not mandatory | P m10 |  |
|**Multiaccount**|
| Basic + OIDC | Create an account with basic and another one with OIDC<br>Switch from one to another one | Both work properly. Both sync properly | P m10 |  |
| OAuth2 + OIDC | Create an account with OAuth2 and another one with OIDC<br>Switch from one to another one | Both work properly. Both sync properly. Correct token renewals |  |  |
| OAuth2 + Basic + OIDC | Create an account with OAuth2, anothe with basic, and another one with OIDC<br>Switch from one to another one | All work properly. all sync properly |  |  |
| OIDC + OIDC | Create two accounts with OIDC<br>Switch from one to another one | All work properly. all sync properly |  |  |
|**Regression**|
| Basic Auth | Enter in a basic auth server | Correct authenticated | P m10 |  |  |
| OAuth2  | Enter in a OAuth2 server | Correct authenticated | P m10 |  |  |
