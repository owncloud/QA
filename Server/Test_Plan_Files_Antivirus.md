### background scan

run these steps between every test case in this chapter:
1. disable antivirus app
2. upload `eicar.com`, `eicar_com.zip` and `eicarcom2.zip` from http://www.eicar.org/85-0-Download.html to the owncloud system under test
3. enable antivirus app
4. set "When infected files were found during a background scan" to "logSetting"
5. set "File size limit" to "fileSizeLimit"
6. wait 15 min (or change `$this->setInterval(60 * 15);` in `lib/cron/task.php` to a smaller number)
7. trigger cron job by running `sudo -u www-data php cron.php`
8. check logfile
9. check files

| Test Case                                | Expected Result                          | Result | Related Comment |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| logSetting = "Only log"<br>fileSizeLimit="-1" | 1. `eicar.com`, `eicar_com.zip` and `eicarcom2.zip` are logged as infected<br>2. all files still exist on the system | ğŸš§     |                 |
| logSetting = "Only log"<br>fileSizeLimit="100" | 1. only `eicar.com` is logged as infected<br>2. all files still exist on the system | ğŸš§     |                 |
| logSetting = "Delete file"<br>fileSizeLimit="-1" | 1. `eicar.com`, `eicar_com.zip` and `eicarcom2.zip` are logged as infected and deleted<br>2. `eicar.com`, `eicar_com.zip` and `eicarcom2.zip` disappear from the system | ğŸš§     |                 |
| logSetting = "Delete file"<br>fileSizeLimit="100" | 1. only `eicar.com` is logged as infected  and deleted<br>2. only `eicar.com` disappears from the system | ğŸš§     |                 |

## Tips how to test different endpoints with curl

1. setup variables:
```
user=admin
pwd=admin
host=localhost
path=owncloud
```

2. split file for chunking
```
split -d -b 50 eicar.com eicar.com_
```
you will end up with `eicar.com_00` and `eicar.com_01`
do the same for the zip files. There will be more "chunks" as the zip files are bigger

3. upload v1 dav path without chunking
```
curl --user $user:$pwd http://$host/$path/remote.php/webdav/virus --request PUT --data-binary "@eicar.com"
```

4. upload v1 dav path with chunking
The amount of chunks might vary depending on the split size and the original file size
```
curl --user $user:$pwd http://$host/$path/remote.php/webdav/virus-chunking-1234-2-0 --request PUT --data-binary "@eicar.com_00" -H "OC-Chunked:1"
curl --user $user:$pwd http://$host/$path/remote.php/webdav/virus-chunking-1234-2-1 --request PUT --data-binary "@eicar.com_01" -H "OC-Chunked:1"
```

5. upload v2 dav path without chunking
```
curl --user $user:$pwd http://$host/$path/remote.php/dav/files/admin/virus --request PUT --data-binary "@eicar.com"
```

6. upload v2 dav path with chunking
The amount of chunks might vary depending on the split size and the original file size
```
curl --user $user:$pwd http://$host/$path/remote.php/dav/uploads/admin/12345 --request MKCOL
curl --user $user:$pwd http://$host/$path/remote.php/dav/uploads/admin/12345/0 --request PUT --data-binary "@eicar.com_00"
curl --user $user:$pwd http://$host/$path/remote.php/dav/uploads/admin/12345/1 --request PUT --data-binary "@eicar.com_01"
curl --user $user:$pwd http://$host/$path/remote.php/dav/uploads/admin/12345/.file --request MOVE -H "Destination: http://$host/$path/remote.php/dav/files/admin/virus"
 ```
