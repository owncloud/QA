# Files Text Editor

### Server: v10

### Setup
1. Install and enable the files_texteditor app.
2. Create a "regularuser" and login to that.
3. When entering or editing text in the file, use a range of different/special characters and multiple lines.
4. When checking file contents after editing, first close the editor window then click the file again to open the editor window.

Note: most tests are covered by the automated UI test suite.
The individual test cases here cover basic functionality, and illustrate the range covered by the automated UI test suite.
Manually performing all the individual test cases can be done, and will give basic confidence in the text editor behavior,
however it is not necessary to manually perform test cases already covered automatically.
