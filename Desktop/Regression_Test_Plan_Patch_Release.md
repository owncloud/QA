## Regression Testplan Patch Release

## Template: 
[Regression_Test_Plan_Patch_Release.md](https://github.com/owncloud/QA/blob/master/Desktop/Regression_Test_Plan_Patch_Release.md)

(from: https://testlink.owncloud.team/linkto.php?tprojectPrefix=desktop&item=testcase&id=desktop-158)

_TO DO_
- So far squish tests only run on Ubuntu, for future: should run on Windows and macOS as well
- Qt and OpenSSL versions: is it necessary to check it here? (for Win and macOS configured in craft, for Linux the system OpenSSL is used, qt packages are ownCloud packages), versions are listed in automated test result (e.g. https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8870#issuecomment-896795228)
- manual check remains for file browser integration (overlay icons) and WinVFS
