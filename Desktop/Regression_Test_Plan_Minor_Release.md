1. Create a new testplan ticket in the owncloud/client repo, copy the text below into it:

```
# Regression test for the Desktop Client

[Test Plan Template](https://github.com/owncloud/QA/blob/master/Desktop/Regression_Test_Plan_Minor_Release.md)

## Previous requirements

Have a Desktop Client vX.X.0 ready to be used for testing.
 -> download URL
Prepare a 10.2.1 server with ssl activated and trusted certificates.
 - `env OC10_VERSION=10.2 bash deploy_oc10_apps.sh --`
 -> server URL
 
Have the lastest released OC server ready with LDAP and two external storages of your choice (SFTP and WND) used for specific tests
 - `env OC10_DNSNAME=oc1080-ldap-DATE bash deploy_oc10_apps.sh oauth2 user_ldap  password_policy files_pdfviewer windows_network_drive=2.0.0`
 -> server URL

Optional: Have an Active Directory server ready to be used with owncloud.

Avoid to have the same test server for all who are testing. You can use an individual latest docker server, e.g.:
 - docker run --rm -ti -p 8080:8080 owncloud/server:10.10.0
 - firefox http://localhost:8080
but testing should be also done with a 'real' server, for that the BTR team can provide some test servers. 

## Testing

- For each test set, choose a random platform win/linux/mac, unless test items specify otherwise. Record which platform was used.
- "Enable logging to temporary folder" and "Log Http traffic" (tab 'Settings', button 'Log Settings') to have log-files available if needed to report an issue.
- Manual testing is only required for tests not covered by automated squish testing (marked as :robot:)
- Make sure all [squish tests](https://confluence.owncloud.com/display/OG/Squish+Testing#SquishTesting-Testplan) run successful in CI 
- If more persons are testing, please write your name beside the section you are currently working on, e.g. @tester1
- Add the test result to the 'Result' column. For success: :heavy_check_mark:, failure: :x: (link the reported #issue to 'Related Comment')

### 2. Folders

- 'Go to local sync folder and create a folder' means: "Open folder" on client dot ... menu, create a new folder in file browser
- 'Verify on the server' means:  the folder is sent from client to server / check either with a) web browser, b) another client, or c) via server introspection
